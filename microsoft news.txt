This headline came from a company that itself wasn't exactly ready for working from home, Microsoft. Right beneath its nostrils, a company called Zoom came along and stole hegemony over a means of communication that Microsoft might, itself, have already mastered.

Yet Microsoft has tried to catch up with its Teams and has clearly devoted much thought to our what-the-hell-is-happening world.

In July, Redmond analyzed what was going on inside its own (virtual) world and discovered some horrific facts. Sample: The share of  IMs being sent increased by 52% between 6pm and midnight.

More recently, though, the company wondered whether we're ready for the hybrid thing and released a Work Trend Index, which tried to paint a more complete picture of the work-life COVID has wrought.

Yes, there's another great disruption coming a year after the last great disruption. Don't you wish that disruptions would auto-disrupt and leave us to a little peace?

The Boss Is Having A Great Time. How About You?
Some of the headlines from Microsoft's work are clear and predictable. Hybrid work will be the new, new thing. Workers are currently exhausted and Gen Z is especially trailing in the wake of the changes.

It was, though, another aspect that offered such a brutal exposition of what's really going on.

Sixty-one percent of leaders described themselves as "thriving."

"You what?" you might mutter. "I'm desperately trying to work out of my bedroom, trapped on Zoom calls for eight hours a day, have no social life and my bosses say they're doing great?"

Yours would be an accurate sentiment. Microsoft, you see, says that those who don't make the decisions are thriving 23 points less than their bosses.

I want to be staggered by this. Companies, after all, insist that they're comprised of teams. Their leaders boast that they're all one big family. They speak of, good Lord, servant leadership.
